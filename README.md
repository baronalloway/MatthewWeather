# Hurricane Matthew Chatbot
This Chatbot would reply by text or phone call with the weather outside. It was developed for students at University of Miami, stranded on campus, who wanted to know what it was like outside. The weather was taken from a weather station on top of the student center.

## Usage
- This is only the server-side response part of the app, that gets the data and serves it as an xml response. You'll need to do the Twilio integration yourself.

More info coming soon.
